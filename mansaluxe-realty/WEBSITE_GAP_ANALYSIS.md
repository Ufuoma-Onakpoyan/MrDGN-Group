## Recommended additions (in priority order)

1. **Legal pages**  
   - Add real **Privacy Policy** and **Terms of Service** (and Cookie Policy if you use cookies/tracking).  
   - Link them from the footer instead of `#`.  
   - Needed for trust and, in many jurisdictions, compliance.

2. **Buying and selling guides**  
   - Two pages (or two clear sections): “Buying with us” and “Selling with us”.  
   - Include process, what to expect, and simple FAQs.  
   - Helps SEO and positions you as a clear, professional option.

3. **Property valuation / calculator**  
   - A simple “Estimate your property value” or “Stamp duty calculator” (or both).  
   - Even a basic tool + “Request a formal valuation” CTA will align with what top brands offer.

4. **Market insights / research**  
   - A “Market Insights” or “Research” section: short reports (e.g. quarterly), key stats, or commentary.  
   - Builds authority and gives a reason for high-value clients to return.

5. **Agent / team directory**  
   - “Our team” or “Find your agent” with names, roles, and contact (or “Enquire” button).  
   - As you add offices or agents, an office/agent locator will become more important.

6. **Lifestyle / video content**  
   - Dedicated video (e.g. company story, area guides, property showcases) and/or a magazine-style “Lifestyle” or “Journal” section.  
   - Differentiates the brand and supports social and SEO.

7. **Awards & affiliations**  
   - On About (or a dedicated “Why us” page): logos for awards, memberships (e.g. real estate bodies), and “As seen in” press.  
   - Strengthens credibility.

8. **Clear listing taxonomy**  
   - Filters or tabs for “For Sale”, “For Rent”, “New developments” (if applicable).  
   - Map view for properties.  
   - Makes the site easier to use and more in line with top portals.
